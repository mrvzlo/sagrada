      "Every day, ragazzo will bring one additional tile of three for you to choose from.",
      "Your task is to lay out the stained glass. Non c'Ã¨ nulla di difficile. Each glass has a thickness from 1 to 6 and one of 5 colors. You cannot place two identical tiles next to each other in terms of color or thickness. Oh, and the customer also wanted some areas to have a strictly specific tile. Tutto qui. When you finish everything, I'll come back and check."
